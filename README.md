# 📊 Data Science Learning Journey

Welcome to my Data Science learning journey! 🌟  
This repository documents my progress, experiments, and learnings as I explore the field of data science — from data wrangling to visualization and storytelling.

## 🧠 About This Project

This project includes Jupyter Labs and Python scripts focused on:

- Understanding data through exploration and visualization
- Practicing data cleaning and preprocessing techniques
- Applying statistical methods to derive insights
- Working with real-world datasets

The goal is to build a solid foundation in data science by combining hands-on experience with theory.
